Work Project : [Using Wavelet Filtering to Perform Seismometer Azimuth Calculation and Data Correction]

Keyword：seismometer, wavelet decomposition and reconstruction filtering, angle rotation, data correction

Using "estimate.py" to estimate azimuth, using "compare.py" to compare the results by three different methods."additional.py" is a few lines of code used to calculate the correlation coefficient change of the data.
Important function descriptions are given in the User Manual。
